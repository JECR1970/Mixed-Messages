# Mixed-Messages
* This is the Mixed Messages CodeCademy project.
* For this project they ask us to create a js code to generate a random message of some sort.
* This message should be the result of randomly combining pieces of text from at least three different sources.
* I stored the pieces of text in three different arrays.
* The type of message is up to the student; I've choosen short, motivational messages.

## Used Languages
* Java Script ES6

## How to use it
Every time you run the code a short message is generated.

## Comments
It took me only a dozen lines of JS code. 
Maybe it is too short, but it does the trick.  
Perhaps I should try for a fancier, longer way of doing it?  
Please, any feedback is welcome.
